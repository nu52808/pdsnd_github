### PDSND Project


### Description
This project is focused on showcasing my capabilities in using Github. I will be showing my skill in being able to create/clone a repository, create commits, and update my remote repository.

### Files used
For this project, the main file being used is the bikeshare.py file and this current README.md file.
### Copyright and licensing information
No license required. However, default copyright laws apply, meaning that I retain all rights to my source code.
### Software
For this project you will need to use a machine that supports GIT or GIT Bash software. This software can be downloaded from the following link: https://git-scm.com/downloads. Once downloaded, please run the file, and save on local device.
### Known Bugs
This project required a .py file, however, the Udacity course that was chosen was for the program called R, therefore an .r file was added to this project instead, using data from the previous project I completed.
